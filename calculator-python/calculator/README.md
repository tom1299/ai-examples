This is a simple calculator project implemented in Python. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Structure

```
calculator/
├── src/
│   ├── calculator.py      # Main functionality of the calculator
│   └── __init__.py        # Marks the src directory as a package
├── tests/
│   ├── test_calculator.py  # Unit tests for the calculator functions
│   └── __init__.py        # Marks the tests directory as a package
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the calculator functions by importing them from the `src.calculator` module. For example:

```python
from src.calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

## Testing
